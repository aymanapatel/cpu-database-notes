# OLAP - History

> Goal: Org use OLAP to extract information from huge data sets that are dumped


## 1990s - Data Cubes

A multi-dimensional array
- Refreshing Materialized Views
- Data Cubes to be specified by a DBA
- Cron job to refresh data


| Tool | Note |
| ---- | ---- |
| MSFT SQL Server | Data Cube |
| Oracle | Data Cube |
| Terradata | OLAP from day1 |
| Sysbase | Data Cube |
| IBM DB2 | Data Cube |
| Informateica |  |

## 2000- Data Warehou ̑ses


- DBMS that were designed for OLAP workloads. Forks of Postgres mostly; but removed storage internals and query execution for use for analytical only
- These used proprietary encoding/formates
- Share Nothing architecture



| DB | Note |
| ---- | ---- |
| Netezza | Forks of Potgres |
| ParAccel | Forks of Potgres |
| MonetDB | Duckdb v1 was based on MonetDB. V2 is not MonetDb |
| Greenplum | Forks of Potgres |
| DataAllegro | MSFT bought and thrw it away |
| Vertica | Forks of Potgres |

Use ETL to move from OLTP to OLAP

![[OLAPv2]]



## 2010: Shared Disk Engines

Decoupling OLAP to do their own storage to something else like S3
Optimize Compute instead of storage

1st Generation managed data files themselves
Now, these allow external entities to add new data files to a schema-less storage such as **data lakes**


![[OLAPv3]]

## 2020s Lakehouse

> Intelligent Data lake (S3, Object storage)

Also a Middleware for data lakes to support schema control and versioning.
Also has transaction CRUD operations
Store changes as row-oriented log-structure files with indexes
Compact data to read-only columnar files

| Snowflake |  |

## Observations of modern data
- People want more than SQL on data
- Decoupling data storage from DBMS reduce ingest/egress barriers
- Most data in **unstructured** / **semi-structured**



# OLAP DBMS Components


1. System catalogs
2. Intermediate Representation
3. Query Optimizers
4. File Format & access libraries
5. Execution engines

## Distributed Query Execution

- Execute OLAP query in distributed system almost === single-node DBMS
- Query plan is DAG of physical operator
	- Every operator,
